Issue Summary:

Duration: May 10, 2024, 08:00 AM - May 11, 2024, 02:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: Affecting 30% of users, the outage resulted in intermittent service disruptions and slow response times across all platforms.
Root Cause: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a surge in user activity compounded by inefficient query execution.
Timeline:

May 10, 2024, 08:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected as monitoring system flagged increased latency.
08:15 AM: Engineering team notified through automated alerts.
08:30 AM: Investigated application server logs for anomalies, suspected database bottleneck.
09:00 AM: Initial assumption: Database overload due to increased traffic.
10:00 AM: Escalated to database administration team for further investigation.
11:30 AM: Misleading path: Focused on network latency issues, leading to no resolution.
01:00 PM: Incident escalated to senior engineering management for additional resources.
May 11, 2024, 01:30 PM: Root cause identified as database connection pool exhaustion.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Cause: The surge in user activity led to a rapid depletion of available database connections, compounded by inefficient query execution strategies.
Resolution: Increased database connection pool capacity and optimized critical database queries. Additionally, implemented throttling mechanisms to regulate incoming requests during peak traffic.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Optimize database queries to reduce execution time.
Implement dynamic scaling mechanisms to auto-adjust database resources based on traffic.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of similar issues.
Tasks:

Patch database connection pooling mechanism to handle higher loads efficiently.
Conduct a comprehensive review of critical database queries for optimization opportunities.
Implement automated scaling policies for database resources to handle traffic spikes seamlessly.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into database performance and resource utilization.
This postmortem outlines the recent outage that impacted our services from May 10 to May 11, 2024. The root cause was identified as database connection pool exhaustion caused by a surge in user activity and inefficient query execution. Immediate actions were taken to increase the database connection pool capacity and optimize critical queries, resolving the issue. To prevent similar incidents, corrective measures include implementing dynamic scaling mechanisms, optimizing queries, and enhancing monitoring systems. These measures aim to improve system resilience and ensure uninterrupted service delivery to our users.
